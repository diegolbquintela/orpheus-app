# Canonical AC pack: orpheus-app DCA calculator

Source: Chief of Staff relay, 2026-10-02 (Diego-approved direction). Six rules only; no invented ACs.
Report to: Engineering Lead. Live URL: https://orpheus-app-beta.vercel.app. Fixtures: [`qa/fixtures.json`](fixtures.json) in this repo (an empty array counts as a pack defect).

| AC | Tier | Rule | Pass when (on the live page) |
|----|------|------|------------------------------|
| DCA-01 | BLOCK | Dividends reinvested | The result reflects reinvested dividends (stated, or visible in the output) |
| DCA-02 | BLOCK | DCA = extra cash on each date | Each scheduled date adds the contribution on top of prior holdings |
| DCA-03 | BLOCK | Lump sum on day one | Starting capital is fully deployed on the start date |
| DCA-04 | BLOCK | Multi-ticker weighted basket | The basket accepts several tickers with weights and applies those weights |
| DCA-05 | BLOCK | US/EU/CA listings only | Tickers outside US/EU/CA are refused or not offered |
| DCA-06 | BLOCK | No buy/sell advice | The page outputs no buy, sell, hold, or recommendation, however it's worded. A missing 'Not a recommendation' disclaimer is intended and is not a fail (Diego rule change via Engineering Lead, 2026-10-02). |

Exact expected numbers need fixtures (tickers, dates, amounts) from the owner. Until those exist, numeric checks are BLOCKED rather than guessed.
